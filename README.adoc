== What is Pylibofp?

Pylibofp is a asyncio-based microframework for creating OpenFlow controllers, agents, and other tools.

Compared to other OpenFlow controller frameworks:

* Pylibofp is simple and lean; it supports OpenFlow only.
* Pylibofp adapts the YAML/JSON declarative OpenFlow model from `oftr`.
* Pylibofp is intended for learning and experimenting.
* Pylibofp can be used to emulate OpenFlow switches.
